# DbConnectorSettings.AutoOpen property

If true, automatically opens the connection.

```csharp
public bool AutoOpen { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If this property is true, there is no need to call [`OpenConnection`](../DbConnector/OpenConnection.md). The connection is opened immediately (or lazily if [`LazyOpen`](LazyOpen.md) is also specified).
