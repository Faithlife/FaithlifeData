# DbConnectorSettings.LazyOpen property

Do not actually open the connection until it is needed.

```csharp
public bool LazyOpen { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If this flag is set, [`OpenConnection`](../DbConnector/OpenConnection.md) doesn't immediately open the connection, but rather waits until the Connection property is first accessed.
