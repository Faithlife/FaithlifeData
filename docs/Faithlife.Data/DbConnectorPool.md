# DbConnectorPool class

Maintains a pool of connectors.

```csharp
public sealed class DbConnectorPool : IAsyncDisposable, IDisposable
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [DbConnectorPool](DbConnectorPool/DbConnectorPool.md)(…) | Creates a new connector pool. |
| [Dispose](DbConnectorPool/Dispose.md)() | Disposes the connector pool. |
| [DisposeAsync](DbConnectorPool/DisposeAsync.md)() | Disposes the connector pool. |
| [Get](DbConnectorPool/Get.md)() | Creates a connector that delegates to a connector in the pool (or a new connector if the pool is empty). |

## Remarks

This is potentially useful if your ADO.NET provider doesn't do its own connection pooling. The database connection of a pooled connector will retain whatever state it had when it was returned to the pool.
