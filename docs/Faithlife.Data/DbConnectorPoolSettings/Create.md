# DbConnectorPoolSettings.Create property

Creates a new connector for the pool.

```csharp
public Func<DbConnector>? Create { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The created connector is wrapped in a connector that stores the actual connector in the pool when disposed. Since the advantage of a connector pool is keeping database connections open, be sure to use [`AutoOpen`](../DbConnectorSettings/AutoOpen.md) (and optionally [`LazyOpen`](../DbConnectorSettings/LazyOpen.md)) when creating the connector.
